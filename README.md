# ejpt_study_notes
These are my study notes for the eJPTv2 exam.

Having passed the exam I have made these public to assist other people that are writing the exam. Particularly for people that may have lost their notes.

The EJPT/EJPT folder are cherry tree notes. To open them in cherry tree do the following:

1. Open Cherry Tree:
2. Click File > Open Folder (Shift+Ctrl+O)
3. Navigate to the folder you downloaded
4. Click Open


**TODO**
Clean up formatting of the notes to make them more readable in a MD format.
