# ejpt_study_notes
These are my study notes for the eJPTv2 exam.

I plan to break this down following the eJPT course provided by INE. However, that may change as I use these notes on an ongoing basis.

Why make my notes public you might ask?
Well, I believe in proof of work. Especially when it comes to learning. I try to document as much as possible whenever I remember to, and I hope that others find this beneficial in the future also :)
