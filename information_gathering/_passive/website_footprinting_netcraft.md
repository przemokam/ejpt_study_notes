Netcraft is a tool that allows us to get all information about target domain. (registrar, web technologies, whois, ssl/tls, ip, etc)

This is a third party service that companies can pay for to confirm their external footprint. There are many online services that provide this.

SSL\TLS information can provide information about when the certificate expires.

NetCraft will also inform you about some common vulns detected and if the site is vulnerable (HeartBleed, etc)

Pulls DNS email security (SPF (can contain IPs) DKIM and DMARC)

Can pull some of the additional technologies that the website is being hosted on (LAMP. wordpress, etc)
