**Shellter**

Installation in Linux requires the use of wine.

Ideally your executable should be something small and easy to execute. Something easy like VNC, NC, 7-zip, etc. This is so the executable keeps the traditional function of the application. Could replace an .exe on a server share to pivot, or utilize in social engineering attacks.

running is pretty easy (sudo wine shellter.exe) and the wizard largely guides you through the use in terminal.
