Samba may run on NETBIOS port as well as SMB port for backwards compatibility.

Typically used to share files over the LAN. Doesn't come with most distros by default, but is commonly installed /enabled and is regularly poorly secured.

Uses username / password authentication. Can BruteForce to get credentials. However, unlike windows you can not use those over SMB for executing commands as a feature. Instead you will need RCE.
