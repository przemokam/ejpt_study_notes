Talking about how windows is developed and how that design philosophy creates vulnerabilities.

Given it's popularity increases the amount of hackers targeting the OS. As this is a popular choice of OS there is publicly available exploit code making it easier to exploit.

Due to the number of versions we have a fragmented attack surface. This means that all host based attacks are specific to the targeted hosts. The internal bureaucracy at an organization can slow down the deployment of newere Operating Systems.

All OS releases share the same dev model and philosphy.

 - All developed with the C programming language making them vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code exec, etc.
 - Not configured to be run securely by default, so additional proactive implementations of security practices are required to configure windows to run securely.
 - new vulns are not patches immediately by microsoft, and due to fragmented philosophy many systems are left unpatched.

Microsoft is also vulnerable to cross platform vulnerabilities ( SQLi , XSS, etc ) along with physical attacks.
