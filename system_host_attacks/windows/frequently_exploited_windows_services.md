IIS - ports 80 and 443 - propriety web server

WebDAV - ports 80 and 443 - HTTP extension that allows clients to update, delete, move and copy files on web server.

SMB / CIFS - port 445 - network file sharing protocol to share files and peripherals between computers on a LAN (runs on top of netBIOS on older systems)

RDP - port 3389 - disabled by default, but often enabled on servers. proprietary GUI remote access protocol to remotely authenticate and interact or administer windows systems

WinRM - windows non GUI remote management protocol that can be used to facilitate remote access normally for administration
